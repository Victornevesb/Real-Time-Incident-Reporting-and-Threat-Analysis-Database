# Real-Time-Incident-Reporting-and-Threat-Analysis-Database
This project involves creating a Python-based system to monitor, store, and analyze real-time incident data (e.g., natural disasters, political events, or security incidents). It will use APIs and open-source data to collect incident reports, store them in a relational database, and perform geospatial and statistical analysis.
